# 3D Shape Reconstruction  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing a 3D shape from a given dataset (`3d_shape_points_data.npz`). The objective is to determine the original shape, identify deformations, and reconstruct the original shape using computational techniques.  

## Dataset  
- **File Name:** `3d_shape_points_data.npz`  
- **Contents:** The dataset contains 3D point cloud data representing an object with possible deformations.  

## Objectives  
1. **Load and Visualize the 3D Shape:** Extract and visualize the point cloud data.  
2. **Identify Deformations:** Analyze distortions present in the given shape.  
3. **Reconstruct the Original Shape:** Apply techniques such as PCA, clustering, or deep learning-based reconstruction to restore the original shape.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- SciPy  
- Open3D (for 3D visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (for data analysis)  

## Usage  
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib scipy open3d scikit-learn
   ```  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells step by step.  

## Expected Outcome  
- A reconstructed 3D shape closely resembling the original object.  
- Insights into the nature of deformations and their possible corrections.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implementing deep learning methods (e.g., autoencoders) for more accurate reconstructions.  
- Applying statistical models to quantify deformation severity.
